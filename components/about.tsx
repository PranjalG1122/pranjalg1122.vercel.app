                    Hey! I'm a young web developer who is passionate about
                    creating interactive and dynamic web applications. My skills
                    are focused on Javascript, React, Nextjs, Nodejs, and
                    Express, which allows me to create robust, scalable, and
                    maintainable web applications. I have a good understanding
                    of UI/UX principles, and I strive to create user-friendly
                    experiences for every project I work on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've always been fascinated by the power of the internet and
                    the way it connects people from all over the world. I also
                    have a keen interest in Machine Learning as I've had
                    experience using OpenAI's ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo and Stable
                    Diffusion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Apart from web development, I have a wide range of interests
                    and hobbies. I love learning about cars and how they work,
                    from classic muscle cars to the latest electric vehicles. I
                    also enjoy watching movies and learning about visual effects
                    and cinematography. As a tech enthusiast, I'm always
                    interested in the latest gadgets and innovations and enjoy
                    tinkering with them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've also travelled across the world and have been to three
                    different continents! I grew up and lived in the US for
                    three years after which I moved to Uganda, where the
                    enriched culture and beautiful landscapes left me in awe.
                    Before coming to settle in India, I lived in Japan for four
                    years. The friendliness of the people and the beauty of the
                    urban and rural landscapes were unforgettable.
